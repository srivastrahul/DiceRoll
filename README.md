# DiceRoll
This project is a single activity Android app to let you "TRULY" randomly generate a number between 1-6 to display as the six sides on the throw of a dice.
I have developed my own algorithm to generate a Truly Random Number instead of using the Random class provided in the language utils.
It is written completely Kotlin using MVVM pattern & data binding.
